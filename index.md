# Alef ad Tav: Learn Hebrew quickly with Michal Nachmany

## What is Alef ad Tav?

Alef ad Tav means A to Z in Hebrew.
Alef is the first letter of the alphabet, and tav is the last one. 
The first step of your journey is learning how to read the letters.
Then we tailor a program according to your needs and learning style.

Some of my students study prayerbook and biblical Hebrew with me.
Others study modern and spoken language.
Some students take an accelerated "marathon" course.
Others study in 8-10 week sessions.
Some prefer to study in a group, others one-on-one.

Alef ad Tav is more than just letters and vowels.
It is culture, warmth, and tea with fresh mint leaves.
